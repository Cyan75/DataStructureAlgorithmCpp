## 2\. Object-Oriented Design

Inheritance, polymorphism, and function overloading support reusable software.

### 2-1\. Object-Oriented Design Principle

*   Abstraction: ADT(Abstract Data Type) specifieas what each operation does but not how it does
*   Encapsulation: different components of a software system should not reveal the internal details of their respective implementations.
*   Modularity: different components of a software system are divided into separate functional units.

### 2-2\. Inheritance and Polymorphism

1.  Constructor and Destructor
    *   **initialiser list**  
        ```c++
        Person::Person(const string& nm, const string& id): name(nm), idNum(id){ }
        ```  

    *   **initialise the base class constructor, and the derived class constructor**  
        ```c++
        Student::Student(const string& nm, const string& id, const string& maj, int year) : Person(nm, id), major(maj), gradYear(year) { }
        ```
    *   constructor initialisation
        *   ```c++
                class ClassA
                {
                    ClassA(int& val):m_val(val)
                    {
                        // instead of m_val = val;
                    }
                }
            ```
2.  Dynamic Instantiation? the base class destructor is automatically called
        
       ```c++
        Student* s = new Student("Carol", "34-927", "Physics", 2014);
        delete s;
       ```

    *   calls `~Student()` and then, calls `~Person()`
3.  Static Binding: scope follows obj's *declared* type

      ```c++
        Person* pp[10];
        pp[0] = new Person(...);
        pp[1] = new Student(...);
      ```

    *   both `pp[0]->someMethod(...)` and `pp[1]->someMethod(...)` call `Person::someMethod(...)`
4.  Dynamic Binding: use of **virtual functions**

      ```c++
        Person* pp[10];
        pp[0] = new Person(...);
        pp[1] = new Student(...);
      ```

    *   `pp[0]->someVirtualFunction(...)` calls `Person::someVirtualFunction(...)`  
        while `pp[1]->someVirtualFunction(...)` calls `Student::someVirtualFunction(...)`
    *   Virtual Destructor: a proper destructor should deallocate each obj. If a base class defines any virtual functions, it should define a virtual destructor, even if it is empty. 
       
5.  Polymorphism: a variable(pointer) takes different types
    *   For a base class S and its derived class T, a pointer `S* p` can point to any obj that belongs to T.
    *   For a virtual member function a() and pointer `p` points to an obj of T, `p->a()` invokes T::a()
    *   **Dynamic Binding. a() is overriden.**
    *   Not interested in whether `p` instantiate S or T.
    *   **A pointer variable p that points to a class object that has at least one virtual function is said to be polymorphic.**
    *   Pointer of generic(base) class & instantiation of specific(derived) obj.
6.  Dynamic Casting

       ```c++
        Person* pp[10];
        pp[0] = new Person(...);
        pp[1] = new Student(...);
        pp[1]−>changeMajor("English");
       ```

    *   pp[1] is a pointer of Person while changeMajor is a function of Student → ERROR!

        Student* sp = dynamic_cast<Student*>(pp[1]);
                        sp−>changeMajor("Chemistry");

    *   **`dynamic_cast <desired type>`**
    *   for polymorphic obj( = has at least one virtual function), Dynamic Casting available.
    *   Dynamic casting is often applied for casting pointers within the class hierarchy.
    *   If an illegal pointer cast is attempted, then the result is a null pointer.
    ```c++
        for (int i = 0; i < 100; i++)
        {
            Student *sp = dynamic_cast<Student*>(pp[i]);
            if (sp != NULL)
                sp−>changeMajor("Undecided");
        }
    ```

7.  Interface vs Abstract Class
    1.  Interface(API, Application Programming Interface)
    2.  Abstract Class: **a Base Class containing any pure virtual function**
        *   provides information about a class' public member functions and how they are called.
        *   Cannot be instantiated.
        *   Pure Virtual Function
                
            ```c++
                virtual int foo() = 0
            ```
                
            ```c++
               class A 
                { 
                    public: virtual void fn() { } 
                };

                class B : public virtual A 
                {
                    public:
                    virtual void fn() { }
                };
            ```
            *   vs (unpure) virtual function `virtual void uVF()`
                *   its definition is given in the base class
                *   the base class can be instantiated
            *   All derived class must redefine the pure virtual function. Otherwise, the derived class also becomes abstract
    3.  Interface: a base class in which all the functions are pure virtual

### 2-3\. Templates

1.  Function Template
    <table>
    <tr>
    <th>Specialised Function</th>
    <th>Generic Function</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>
   
    ```c++
        int integerMin(int a, int b)
        { 
            return (a < b ? a : b); 
        }
    ```
    </td>

    <td>

    ```c++
        template <typename T>
        T genericMin(T a, T b) 
        { 
            return (a < b ? a : b); 
        }
    ```
</td>
</tr>
</table>

1.  Class Template
    *   First Define a member function
        ```c++
            template <typename T>
            class BasicVector 
            { 
                public:
                BasicVector(int capac = 10);
                T& operator[ ](int i) ////overload operator []
                { return a[i]; }
                private:
                T* a;                 ///// array
                int capacity;         ////// length of the array
            };
        ```    
    *   Then, define another member function out of the class(e.g.constructor)
        ```c++
            template <typename T>     // constructor
            BasicVector<T>::BasicVector(int capac) 
            { capacity = capac;
                a = new T[capacity];   // allocate array storage
            }
        ```    

    *   Instantiation is done by assigning actual type in the angled brackets
        ```c++
            BasicVector<int> iv(5);     // vector of 5 integers
            BasicVector<double> dv(20); // vector of 20 doubles
            BasicVector<string> sv(10); // vector of 10 strings
        ```    

2.  Templated Arguments

### 2-4\. Exceptions

*   specify a function's exception: we don't need to catch exceptions in the function  
    ```c++
    void calculator() throw(except1, except2) {. . .}
    ```
*   w/o throw: throw any exception  
    ```c++
        void func1();           // can throw any exception
        void func2() throw();   // can throw no exceptions
    ```                
*   generic exception class: using this as the base class, for any exception e, we can output e's error message by invoking the inherited getMessage function.

### ADDITIONAL NOTES????

*   Different meaning of Class, Object, and Instantiation in C++ and java
    *   In object-oriented programming, some writers say that you instantiate a class to create an object, a concrete instance of the class. The object is an executable file that you can run on a computer.
    *   In the object-oriented programming language, Java, the object that you instantiate from a class is, confusingly enough, called a class instead of an object. In other words, using Java, you instantiate a class to create a specific class that is also an executable file you can run on a computer.
